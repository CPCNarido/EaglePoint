🦅 EaglePoint – Golf Course Management System

📅 Duration: October 18 – December 1
🏛️ Developed for: Philippine Army Golf Course
🎯 Purpose: To streamline the daily operations of the golf course through digital reservation, player dispatching, and bay activity monitoring.

📖 Overview

EaglePoint is a Golf Course Management System designed to optimize player flow and staff coordination.
It enables military and civilian players to register or reserve playtime, while allowing cashiers, dispatchers, and admins to manage sessions efficiently.

This system ensures that military members (both registered and walk-ins) bypass cashier processing and go directly to the Dispatcher,
while civilians are processed through the Cashier for timed sessions only.

📱 System Modules
🧑‍✈️ Dispatcher Module

Queues servicemen (Tee Boys/Girls) only.

Assigns players (Members and Civilians) to available bays.
