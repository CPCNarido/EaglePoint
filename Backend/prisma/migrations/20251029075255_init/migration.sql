-- Placeholder migration for 20251029075255_init
-- This migration was applied to the database but the migration.sql file was missing locally.
-- Prisma migrate expects this file to be present to match migration history.

-- NOTE: This is a placeholder that does NOT attempt to re-run DDL against the database.
-- If you have the original migration SQL from VCS or a backup, restore that file here instead.

-- If you plan to keep the current database schema (recommended for production),
-- mark this migration as applied with `npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20251029075255_init`.

-- If this is a dev DB and you can reset, you may instead run `npx prisma migrate reset` to
-- recreate the schema from migrations (data will be lost).

-- Placeholder content (no-op):
-- <no SQL; this file intentionally left as a placeholder to allow migrate tooling to continue>
